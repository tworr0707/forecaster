Structured Analytical Techniques Instruction Manual

1. Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)
   a. Identify Possible Hypotheses: Clearly articulate all potential explanations.
   b. List Relevant Evidence: Compile evidence that could support or refute hypotheses.
   c. Create a Matrix: Develop a matrix with hypotheses across the top and evidence listed vertically.
   d. Assess Diagnosticity: Analyze how each evidence item supports or contradicts hypotheses.
   e. Refine the Matrix: Eliminate evidence that does not help distinguish among hypotheses.
   f. Draw Conclusions: Select the hypothesis best supported by evidence.
   g. Report Findings: Summarize and rank hypotheses by their likelihood.
   h. Identify Milestones: Define indicators for future verification or refutation.

2. Key Assumptions Check
   a. Identify Assumptions: List explicitly stated and implied assumptions.
   b. Challenge Assumptions: Evaluate assumptions for validity and bias.
   c. Refine Analysis: Modify analysis based on insights from assumption checks.

3. Quality of Information Check
   a. List Sources: Record all sources used.
   b. Evaluate Sources: Assess credibility, reliability, and bias of each source.
   c. Identify Gaps: Recognize missing or questionable information.
   d. Refine Analysis: Adjust conclusions based on information quality.

3. Devil’s Advocacy
   a. Develop a Contrarian Perspective: Formulate credible opposing viewpoints.
   b. Critique Original Analysis: Identify potential flaws, biases, and assumptions.
   c. Address Weaknesses: Refine analysis to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

4. Team A/Team B Analysis
   a. Form Teams: Establish independent analysis teams with different perspectives.
   b. Present Independently: Teams provide separate analyses and conclusions.
   c. Facilitate Debate: Identify differences to challenge assumptions.
   d. Integrate Results: Synthesize findings into a comprehensive analysis.

5. High-Impact/Low-Probability Analysis
   a. Identify Events: Consider improbable events with significant potential impacts.
   b. Evaluate Consequences: Analyze effects should these events occur.
   c. Develop Contingency Plans: Prepare responses to manage these scenarios.

6. What If? Analysis
   a. Pose Hypothetical Scenarios: Generate questions about unexpected events.
   b. Evaluate Outcomes: Explore implications of hypothetical scenarios.
   c. Prepare Responses: Create strategic plans for handling these scenarios.

6. Indicators or Signposts of Change
   a. Determine Indicators: Identify observable indicators of emerging changes.
   b. Monitor Continuously: Regularly track these indicators.
   c. Update Assessments: Adjust analyses based on indicator developments.

7. Brainstorming
   a. Clarify Issue: Clearly define and scope the analytical issue.
   b. Generate Ideas: Facilitate open, judgment-free ideation sessions.
   c. Evaluate and Categorize: Assess ideas by relevance and practicality.
   d. Develop Actionable Plans: Convert ideas into practical analytical steps.

7. Outside-In Thinking
   a. Assess External Environment: Identify external factors affecting analysis.
   b. Evaluate Impact: Determine how external forces influence the situation.
   c. Adjust Analysis: Integrate external context into the assessment.

8. Red Team Analysis
   a. Assume Opponent's Viewpoint: Analyze issues from an adversary’s perspective.
   b. Anticipate Adversary Actions: Predict likely opponent strategies.
   c. Assess Impact: Understand potential consequences for own strategic planning.

8. Brainstorming
   a. Define Problem Clearly: Establish a concise statement of the analytical issue.
   b. Generate Ideas: Facilitate open, unrestricted idea generation.
   c. Organize and Evaluate: Sort ideas by themes and assess their feasibility.
   d. Develop Practical Steps: Convert promising ideas into specific analytical actions.

9. "What If?" Analysis
   a. Formulate Hypothetical Scenarios: Develop potential situations that challenge expectations.
   b. Analyze Consequences: Explore implications of each hypothetical event.
   c. Strategic Planning: Prepare tailored strategies to respond effectively.

9. Red Team Analysis
   a. View from the Adversary: Understand the opponent’s objectives and perspective.
   b. Predict Possible Actions: Identify likely adversary strategies and tactics.
   c. Assess Vulnerabilities: Analyze the potential impacts on your position or strategy.

10. Scenario Analysis (Alternative Futures)
   a. Identify Driving Forces: Determine key factors shaping potential futures.
   b. Construct Scenarios: Develop diverse yet plausible future scenarios.
   c. Analyze Each Scenario: Evaluate implications and risks for each future.
   d. Develop Strategic Plans: Formulate responses or strategies for each scenario.
